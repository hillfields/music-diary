          <h2 class="text-center">About</h2>
          <p>I've always wanted to keep a diary of some sort, somewhere to jot my thoughts down so that I can look back at them. I've tried several times, but I can't get into the habit of actually doing it. Sometimes I'll forget, but other times I have trouble writing anything.</p>
          <p>But there is one thing I don't have to force myself to do: listening to music.</p>
          <p>Music is such a wonderful thing. It fills in the long periods of silence during those long rides on the train or in the car. It conveys all sorts of emotions that I have trouble expressing myself. And with the convenience of music streaming platforms, I can listen to whatever I feel like at the moment. Sometimes I'll even put the same song on loop for hours just because I like it that much.</p>
          <p>So then I started to keep a music diary, with the goal of writing down <strong id="highlight">one song a day</strong>. It could be a song that captures a specific moment or just something I happened to find or listen to on that day. I think of these songs as being associated with "core memories" - I can look back at each one and instantly remember what I was doing and how I felt on that day. The songs I choose might not mean anything to someone else, but they mean something to me.</p>
